# Iago’s Manipulation: The Distort-ability of the Human Psyche  
## *Othello* Act 4, Scene 1, Lines 13-60

**Iago**: A name meaning "supplanter," which is shown through his usurping of Cassio’s position and manipulation of Othello.  

*==IAGO=={Q1655364}*  
If they do nothing, ’tis a ==Venial Slip=={description="Definition: A minor, forgivable mistake. Iago minimizes the gravity of adultery, equating it to a 'slip,' making it seem initially harmless to subtly manipulate Othello's emotions. This euphemism demonstrates Iago’s tactic of gradual persuasion."}.  
But if I give my wife a ==handkerchief=={description="The handkerchief carries a large symbolic meaning throughout the play. It demonstrates Othello’s blinding love, trust, and later, his paranoia. Iago leverages Othello's superstition to manipulate him. In Othello’s mind, the handkerchief’s loss signifies betrayal. His obsessiveness reflects symptoms of delusional jealousy which Iago takes advantage of in order to manipulate Othello emotionally."}—

*==OTHELLO=={Q1966171}*  
What then?  

*IAGO*  
Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,  
She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.  

*OTHELLO*  
She is protectress of her honor, too.  
May she give that?  

*IAGO*  
==Her honor is an essence that’s not seen=={description="Iago suggests that honor is subjective and is only a perception rather than a quality. He implies that Desdemona may seem virtuous without actually being so. This suggestion plants seeds of doubt in Othello's mind."}  
They have it very oft that have it not.  
But for the handkerchief—  

*OTHELLO*  
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.  
Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory  
==As doth the raven o’er the infectious house=={description="A raven flying over a plague-stricken house is an omen of death and misfortune."},  
Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.  

*IAGO*  
Ay, what of that?  

*OTHELLO*  
That’s not so good now.  

*IAGO*  
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?  
Or heard him say (as ==knaves=={description="Iago refers to gossiping knaves—those who spread rumors after being rejected by women, suggesting that Cassio might have done the same."} be such abroad,  
Who having, by their own importunate suit  
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,  
Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose  
But they must blab)—  

*OTHELLO*  
Hath he said anything?  

*IAGO*  
==He hath, my lord, but be you well assured, no more than he’ll unswear.=={description="Iago’s ambiguity neither confirms nor denies Cassio’s guilt which makes Othello desperate for certainty and further fuels his suspicions."}  

*OTHELLO*  
What hath he said?

</div>  

*IAGO*  
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.  

*OTHELLO*  
What? What?  

*IAGO*  
==Lie=={description="Iago is once again ambiguous. This allows the seed that Iago plants in Othello's head regarding adultery to grow even more. Othello's jealous mind fills in the gaps in Iago's speech with his own misguided interpretation of the narrative."}—  

*OTHELLO*  
With her?  

*IAGO*  
With her—on her—what you will.  

*OTHELLO*  
Lie with her? Lie on her? We say “lie on her”  
when they ==belie=={description="Lie serves as a double entendre. Othello's repetition of 'lie' demonstrates both the physical act and deception."} her. Lie with her—  
Zounds, that’s ==fulsome=={description="Definition: lustful"}! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief.  
To confess and be hanged for his labor.  
First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble  
at it. ==Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction.=={description="His fragmented speech also reflects a psychological breakdown, showing the corruption of his psyche by Iago. This breakdown exhibits characteristics of a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES). This is a stress-induced reaction where extreme emotional turmoil causes seizure episodes."}  
It is not  
words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and  
lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O,  
devil!

*IAGO*  
==Work on, my medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,=={description="Iago's description of his manipulation as 'medicine' suggests that he sees Othello’s downfall as an experiment in psychological control."}  
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,  
All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!  
My lord, I say. Othello!
