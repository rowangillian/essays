*==IAGO=={Q1655364}*</br>
    If they do nothing, ’tis a **venial slip**. </br>
    But if I give my wife a **handkerchief**—  </br>

*==OTHELLO=={Q26833}*</br>
    What then?  </br>

*IAGO*</br>
    Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,  </br>
    She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.  </br>

*OTHELLO*</br>
    She is protectress of her honor, too.  </br>
    May she give that?  </br>

*IAGO*</br>
    Her honor is an essence that’s not seen;  </br>
    They have it very oft that have it not.  </br>
    But for the handkerchief—  </br>

*OTHELLO*</br>
    By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.  </br>
    Thou saidst—O, it comes o’er my memory  </br>
  **As doth the raven o’er the infectious house**,  </br>
    Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.  </br>

*IAGO*</br>
    Ay, what of that?  </br>

*OTHELLO* </br>
    That’s not so good now.  </br>
    
*IAGO*                                                     What </br> 
    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?  </br>
    Or heard him say (as **knaves** be such abroad,  </br>
    Who having, by their own importunate suit  </br>
    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,  </br>
    Convincèd or supplied them, cannot choose  </br>
    But they must blab)—  </br>

*OTHELLO*
    Hath he said anything?  </br>

*IAGO*  
    He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,  </br>
    No more than he’ll unswear.  </br>

*OTHELLO* </br>
    What hath he said?  </br>

*IAGO* </br>
    Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.  </br>

*OTHELLO*  </br>
    What? What?  </br>

*IAGO*  </br>
    Lie—  </br>

*OTHELLO* </br>
    With her?  </br>

*IAGO* </br>
    With her—on her—what you will.  </br>

*OTHELLO* </br>
    Lie with her? Lie on her? We say “lie on her”  </br>
    when they **belie** her. Lie with her— <Zounds,> that’s  </br>
   **fulsome**! Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief.  </br>
    To confess and be hanged for his labor.  </br>
    First to be hanged and then to confess—I tremble  </br>
    at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing  </br>
    passion without some instruction. It is not  </br>
    words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and  </br>
    lips—is ’t possible? Confess—handkerchief—O,  </br>
    devil!  

*IAGO* </br>
    Work on,  </br>
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are  </br>
    caught,  </br>
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,  </br>
    All guiltless, meet reproach.—What ho! My lord!  </br>
    My lord, I say. Othello!  </br>
